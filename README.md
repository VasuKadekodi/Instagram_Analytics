# 📊💻 Instagram User Analytics

In this project, we will dive deep into Instagram User Analytics and SQL Fundamentals to provide valuable insights to the product and management teams. The project is designed to help teams make informed decisions for marketing campaigns, feature development, user engagement, and overall business growth.

🔍 For marketing, we will identify the most loyal users, inactive users, contest winners, top hashtags, and the best day to launch ad campaigns. These insights will help the marketing team design effective campaigns that reach a wider audience and boost user engagement.

💰 For investor metrics, we will provide data on user engagement and the presence of fake accounts on the platform. Our analysis will demonstrate Instagram's performance compared to other social media platforms, proving its relevance and growth potential.

📈 Throughout the project, we will leverage SQL Fundamentals to extract and analyze data from Instagram's database. With this powerful tool, we will provide comprehensive data analysis that will help teams across the business to make data-driven decisions.

💡 By completing this project, we will provide valuable insights into Instagram's user engagement, marketing strategies, and growth potential, all while demonstrating our proficiency in SQL Fundamentals.
